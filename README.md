# mod_reactjs_api
A slightly modified version of the view is included in this update

I used the standard Appbar and Menuitems from Material-ui design. 
For this demo -- i did some inline css scrypting for styles. Generally, i'd prefer to take the css out to its own file.
I did install the module required for this but didn't mess with webpack.config to add the loader.

Also, another small module i used is react-materialize which comes with standard Footer and few other elements that can be readily used on the page.


Thank you !
